PinballVRcade-Realistic
=============

Patcher for Pinball Arcade that enables Oculus Rift support (Windows only)


This is an updated Version by Daniel Korgel and is based on PinballVRcade by cbdillon.

The aim for this fork is to provide a more realistic feeling. I'm actually developing this for myself and my VR-Pinball Setup. So this Version is designed to be played in a standing position.

This Version version uses Oculus SDK Version 0.5.1 and the Project files were updated to Visual Studio 2013

Controls
==============


Use F5 to reset Position

Debug: Use F6 to cycle through different Texture Filters (all make no visual differences or freeze rendering)


If you want to compile this Project:
==============


1) The Oculus SDK Version 0.5.0.1 has to be placed in C:\OculusSDK\ (for example C:\OculusSDK\LICENSE.txt )

2) You need the (newest) DirectX SDK from June 2010 installed at its default location (If it shows an error uninstall VC++ Redistributable for VS2013 x86 and x64 and try again)
