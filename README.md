PinballVRcade
=============

Patcher for Pinball Arcade that enables Oculus Rift support (Windows only)


This is an updated Version by Daniel Korgel and is based on PinballVRcade by cbdillon.

By now I just updated the Patcher to the new Oculus SDK Version 0.4.4 and I tweaked some values for a more realistic feeling.
