PinballVRcade-Realistic
=============

Patcher for Pinball Arcade that enables Oculus Rift support (Windows only)


This is an updated Version by Daniel Korgel and is based on PinballVRcade by cbdillon.

By now I just updated the Patcher to the new Oculus SDK Version 0.4.4 and I tweaked some values for a more realistic feeling. Also the Project was Updated for use with Visual Studio 2013

==============
If you want to compile this Project:
1) The Oculus SDK Version 0.4.4 hast to be placed in C:\OculusSDK\ (for example C:\OculusSDK\LICENSE.txt )
2) You need the (newest) DirectX SDK from June 2010. (If it gives you Errors uninstall VC++ Redistributable for VS2010 x86 and x64 and try again)
